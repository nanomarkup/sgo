improvements & bugs
    - update documentation
    - use a short name for functions (try it for adapters)
    - check all methods in interfaces
    - fix all external dependencies - github.com/*
    - validate sb code before running the gen command
    - resolve interfaces with different number of methods, typeA can have less number of methods than typeB
          fix "Builder    interface{}" to "Builder    builder" of "SmartBuilder" struct in "app" package

core features
    - add a struct initialization into an item use brackets for overriding global settings, usage: field struct { code }
